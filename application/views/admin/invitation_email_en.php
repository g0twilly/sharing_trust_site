Congratulations!

<br><br>
Thank you for participating in the The Exchange! 
<br><br>

<p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:1.4em; text-align:left;">We received all replies on your investment from all partners you interacted with. Good news: given your investment profile, you made it to Phase 2! Phase two is going to take place in a few weeks, at which time you're going to receive a second invitation to play. Your score in phase 2 determines your chances to win the big prize.
<p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:1.4em; text-align:left;">
Our research relies on you returning for the next round -- we are counting on you!
<br><br>

Sincerely,
<br><br>
