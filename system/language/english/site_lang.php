<p> You are invited to participate in a research study about the effect of participation in online communities on your social life. We are particularly interested in learning how your interactions with people evolve over time. For this reason, we ask that you participate in playing The Exchange game a total of two times. The game has been developed by a team of researchers at Stanford University in collaboration with Airbnb.

<p>
If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked to answer some preliminary questions and participate in a game. The preliminary questions are related to your experience with online communities. We will also ask for your name and email address (confidential data). We will use the confidential data to send you reminders to participate again within eight weeks of the last time you played (at the most). 

<p>
We may use the confidential data to contact you again before December 31, 2017 to participate in future research projects.

<p>
The game you will be playing in this study is an “investment” game, where you
will play against other participants and decide how many points to give to them
or keep for yourself. We will use all the points you accumulated in the
investment game to determine your total score. We will assign a prize of &#36;100
to the first 100 winners.

<p>
Payments may only be made to U.S. citizens, legal resident aliens, and those who have a work eligible visa.

<p>
We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. There are no risks or benefits to you associated with this research.

<p>
All the data we will be collecting from you will be kept in a secure facility at Stanford University with restricted access to it regulated by the Principal Investigator. Stanford University will keep this data until December 31, 2017.

<p>
The data we will be collecting from you will be shared with Airbnb.  Airbnb will create an anonymized version of the data (no confidential data) and give it back to Stanford University to retain for future research. 

<p>
To learn more about the research team behind this project please visit, http://www.stanford.edu/~pparigi/TheAirbnbStanfordProject.html

<p>
Participation in this study is completely voluntary. You must be at least 18 years old to participate in this study. Even if you decide to participate now, you may still stop playing at any time. You may choose not to answer any of the questions or to stop playing the game for any reason. You may choose to ignore our reminders and not come back to play the game.

<p>
If you have questions about this study, you may contact Paolo Parigi at (650) 721-2648 or by email at airbnb_stanford@stanford.edu
