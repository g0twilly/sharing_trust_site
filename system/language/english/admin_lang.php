Dear %s:

Thank you your ongoing participation in The Exchange!  Your responses so far have been fundamental in forwarding critical research.  But, the study is not yet over—and we do not want your efforts to go to waste!

Recently, we sent an email inviting you to play in the next round of The Exchange.  One of the most powerful aspects of our study is the fact that it is being conducted over an extended period of time.  Experiments that require multiple responses over long time periods often have many problems with response rates.  Sometimes, the issues are so severe the experiment has to be abandoned completely.

With your help, this will not happen!

Everything is set for the next round.  Click the link to play:

All of us here in the Exchange Research Team sincerely appreciate your continued assistance in this endeavor.

Sincerely,   
The Exchange Research Team.
